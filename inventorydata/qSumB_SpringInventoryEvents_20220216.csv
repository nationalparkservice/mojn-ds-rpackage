Perhaps the best indicator of where water first approaches the surface at the head of the complex is a patch of juncus in the otherwise dry wash, appx 30m upstream of where the source pt and photos were taken.  It is also difficult to determine the end of the spring complex b/c, although the spring brook dries up, there is evidence of the spring brook continuing nearly to the source of Junco Spring.

The water emerges along a rock face deep below the boulders clogging the wash.  The water collects in deep sandy pools beneath the boulders and is difficult to determine the spring brook length due to the lack of space between the rocks near the bottom of the heap where the water is. Above the spring, riparian vegetation grows in a small open area. GPS coordinates were take on top of the rock pile above the spring because of poor satellite reception. An upstream photo was not possible due to the innablity to navigate the rocks and quicksand-like springbrook at the bottom of the wash. The pools seemed to terminate at a rock wall ~30m from the source. Lots of algae present with Sporobulus contractus.
